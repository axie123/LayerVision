# LayerVision
LayerVision is a type of Machine Learning application that I have been working on to allow data scientists, engineers, and researchers to deploy and keep track of their deep learning models with more ease.

This version of the application is built on a Flask backend and a HTML & CSS frontend. It will incorporate some elements of what is shown in the previous versions of the application. 

## Features

With this application, you are able to:

- Give hyperparameters to model. 
- Edit model hyperparameters.
- Delete redundant models.
- View loss and accuracy of the model with graphs, including:
  * Training Loss
  * Training Accuracy
  * Testing Loss
  * Testing Accuracy
- Feed the set hyperparameters of the model to the python file with ease.

## Installation

To install, you can clone the repository in your specified file on the command prompt:

```bash

```
